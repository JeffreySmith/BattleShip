* TODO Features
  ** Need a way to switch main image out for other imagse
  ** Add animation class and replace all sdl_surfaces that appear with that class
  ** Modify Timer class so that "Events" can be run every specified amount of time
  ** Allow modification of sprite sizes so that hit boxes can be changed easily
  ** Make it easier to compile on other platforms (Maybe use cmake?)

* TODO Bugs/Testing
  ** Still haven't tested buttons -- Could work, might not do anything
  ** Can't get it compiling on osx with g++ -- Complains that cmath calls are not 64bit
  ** Currently only works in osx
  ** Need a way of testing to make sure that my changes work in a real game
